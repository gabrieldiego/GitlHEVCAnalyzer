Introduction
============

The VideoAnalyzer is a fork from Gitl HEVC Analyzer made by Huang Li that intends to add support to the new codec AV1.

The project was renamed accordingly to avoid confusion of projects and to reflect the new feature, but the authorship of most of the code still belongs to the original project.


What is Gitl HEVC Analyzer
==========================

Why Gitl HEVC Analyzer
======================

First, all the commercial HEVC analyzers are too expensive.

Second, we need to draw additional graphics on the analysis results. It supports custom filters. In fact, all the features are implemented via custom filters.

Features
========

Support YUV420 (**8bit**) bitstream.

For historical reasons, besides formal HEVC bitstream, it also supports bitstreams generated by older HM encoders (HM-4.0, HM-5.2, HM-10.0 and HM-12.0).

How To Build
============

Written in C++ with Qt5 (c++11 support required)
You should get and install **Qt 5.1.0 or higher**.

1.  Clone this repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gabrieldiego/VideoAnalyzer.git
```

2.  Init & update the submodules.
```bash
cd VideoAnalyzer
git submodule update --init --recursive
git submodule update --recursive
```

3a. Build on linux:
```bash
./build_makefiles.sh
./build.sh
```

3b. Build on Windows (under MinGW, not tested yet)
```bash
./build_makefiles.sh
./build.sh
```

3c. Build on macosx:
```bash
# in case you don't have qt5 installed
# brew install qt5
./build_makefiles.sh
./build.sh
```

Instead of the building on the command line , Qt Creator is supported. Clone this project and its submodules, then open `VideoAnalyzer.pro` in Qt Creator.
